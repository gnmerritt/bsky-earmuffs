# bsky-earmuffs

Create & update automatic moderation lists

To make a new list, create a configuration file (see `earmuffs.json` for an example) that names the list and defines includes (accounts to add to the list) and excludes (accounts that will not be included on the list, handled after the includes are resolved).
